    "The data mining engineer interprets the models according to his domain knowledge, the data mining success criteria and the desired test design. This task interferes with the subsequent evaluation phase. Whereas the data mining engineer judges the success of the application of modeling and discovery techniques more technically, he contacts business analysts and domain experts later in order to discuss the data mining results in the business context. Moreover, this task only considers models whereas the evaluation phase also takes into account all other results that were produced in the course of the project. The data mining engineer tries to rank the models. He assesses the models according to the evaluation criteria. As far as possible he also takes into account business objectives and business success criteria. In most data mining projects, the data mining engineer applies a single technique more than once or generates data mining results with different alternative techniques. In this task, he also compares all results according to the evaluation criteria.\n",
