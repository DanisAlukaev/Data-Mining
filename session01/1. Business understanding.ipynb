Often the client has many competing objectives and constraints that must be properly balanced.

In addition to the primary business objective, there are typically other related business questions that the customer would like to address. For example, the primary business goal might be to keep current customers by predicting when they are prone to move to a competitor. Examples of related business questions are \"How does the primary channel (e.g., ATM, visit branch, internet) a bank customer uses affect whether they stay or go?\" or \"Will lower ATM fees significantly reduce the number of high-value customers who leave?\"\n","\n","#### Business success criteria \n","\n","Describe the criteria for a successful or useful outcome to the project from the business point of view. This might be quite specific and able to be measured objectively, such as reduction of customer churn to a certain level or general and subjective such as \"give useful insights into the relationships.\" In the latter case it should be indicated who makes the subjective judgment.\n","\n","\n","------------------------"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### <u>Answer</u>:\n","\n","#### Background\n","In the current market situation customer has many option where to buy a similar item.

This may include two components: \n","(1) A glossary of relevant business terminology, which forms part of the business understanding available to the project.
